{"data":{"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"CS Study Notes","description":"This is my ever growing study notes. It covers many areas of computer science / software engineering, things I have learnt and am learning. I find it very useful to write things down so that I have a place to refer back to when needed. So here it is. It's not really meant as a blog for you to learn, ultimately these documents are just a representation of my logical flow. Still, I hope you may find some of them is useful. If you have any questions or like to point out any mistakes, feel free to leave a issue on github.","author":"@ZhangLinghan"}}}}
