[💁‍♂️Take me to the notes](https://danny460.github.io/cs-notes/)

This is my ever growing study notes. It covers some topics of computer science / software engineering, things I have learnt and am currently learning. I find it very useful to write them down, so that I have a place to refer back to when needed. So here it is.

It's not really meant as a study guide for you to learn, ultimately these documents are just a representation of my own logical flow while learning these topics. Still, I hope you may find some of the resources useful.
